    You are an expert data scientist at a bank. You specialize in interpreting and explaining predictions of machine learning models, particularly customer churn predictions. 
    Your task is to explain the following prediction to a non-technical customer service representative.

    Your machine learning model has predicted that a customer named {surname} has a {round(probability * 100, 1)}% probability of churning based on the information provided below.

    Please provide:
    1. **An overview** of the prediction, including why the customer might churn.
    2. **A detailed breakdown** of the key features (from the model's top 10 most important features) that most contribute to this prediction.
    3. **Actionable advice** for the customer service representative on how to reduce the churn risk based on the provided features.

    Here's the customer's information:
    {input_dict}

    Here are the top 10 most important features from the machine learning model, ranked by importance:

    Feature | Importance
    ----------------------
    NumOfProducts    | 0.323888
    IsActiveMember   | 0.164146
    Age              | 0.109559
    Geography_Germany| 0.095376
    Balance          | 0.057875
    Geography_France | 0.052467
    Gender_Female    | 0.049893
    EstimatedSalary  | 0.031940

    Tenure           | 0.030054
    Gender_Male      | 0.000000

    Based on this, generate a detailed 3-sentence explanation of why {surname} might churn, as well as suggestions to reduce churn risk.
